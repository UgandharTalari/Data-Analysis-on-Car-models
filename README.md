# Data-Analysis-on-Car-models
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the development of several machine learning models to predict the price of a car based on its features. It includes:

Data Collection: Importing a dataset with car features such as brand, model, year, price, mileage, etc.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore the relationships between car features and sales.
Model Building: Implementing machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting using Scikit-Learn to predict car sales.
Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

Objectives: Providing a fair estimation of car prices to determine if a dealer is offering fair value or if a personal valuation is reasonable.

Tools Used in the Project
Python: The programming language used for data analysis and model development.
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for coding, documentation, and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data trends and relationships.
Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models, including linear regression and other algorithms.
